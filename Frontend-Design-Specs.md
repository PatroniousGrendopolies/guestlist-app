### Accessibility Compliance
- **Contrast**: All text meets WCAG AA standards

- **Color Independence**: No information conveyed by color alone

### Brand Consistency
- **Logo Usage**: Minimal, clean presentation

- **No Decoration**: Avoid gradients, shadows, or ornamental elements
- **Consistent Spacing**: Use Tailwind's spacing scale consistently

### Quality Assurance Checklist
- [ ] All buttons use `rounded-full`
- [ ] All cards use `rounded-xl`
- [ ] No `border-2` used anywhere (only `border`)
- [ ] Gray cards have no borders
- [ ] No red text for errors/warnings
- [ ] Capacity meter numbers are `text-[10px]`
- [ ] Headers have no black backgrounds
- [ ] Button text is `text-sm`
- [ ] NO bold text anywhere (`font-medium`, `font-semibold`, `font-bold` forbidden)

## USER EXPERIENCE PATTERNS & REFINEMENTS

### Guest Card Layout (DJ/Promoter Management Pages)
**Compact Card Design:**
- **Line 1**: Name and +N count on left, +/- adjustment buttons on right
  - Example: `Sarah Johnson +2` [−][+]
  - +/- buttons only show for pending guests that belong to the current user
  - Buttons: `w-6 h-6 rounded-full border border-gray-300`
- **Line 2**: Instagram handle (if present) as blue clickable link
- **Line 3**: Status badge on left, action buttons on right (same line)
  - Status badge: "Pending", "Approved", "Checked In", or "Denied"
  - Action buttons (for pending guests): [Deny] [Approve]
- **No extra vertical spacing** - cards should be compact and scannable

**"Added By" Tag Rules:**
- **Never show** when viewing "My List" (redundant - all guests belong to user)
- **Never show** when Approve/Deny buttons are present (redundant - implies ownership)
- **Only show** in "Complete Guestlist" view for guests NOT belonging to current user

### Button Text Sizing - Adaptive
**Dynamic font sizing to prevent wrapping:**
- Default button text: `text-sm`
- If button text wraps to multiple lines: automatically use `text-xs` with `leading-tight`
- Examples:
  - "Request additional spots" → `text-xs leading-tight`
  - "Review pending guests" → `text-xs leading-tight`
- Keep one-word buttons at `text-sm` ("Copy", "Share", "Approve", etc.)

### Link Sharing Interface
**Copy vs Share distinction:**
- **"Copy" button**: Only copies to clipboard (no Web Share API)
  - Button text: "Copy" (not "Link")
  - Action: Direct clipboard copy with fallback for mobile Safari
- **"Share" button**: Triggers native share sheet
  - Uses Web Share API if available
  - Falls back to copy if not available
- **Link input field**:
  - Clicking the input field itself should copy the link (acts as secondary copy button)
  - Add `cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-200` to indicate clickability

**Copy feedback animation:**
- When link is copied, link text should **completely disappear** (`opacity-0`)
- "Copied!" message should appear **centered** in the input field
- Use `transition-opacity` for smooth fade
- Auto-dismiss after 2 seconds
- Position: `absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center`

### Capacity Meter Label Positioning
**"Pending" label collision avoidance:**
- Calculate pending section center position: `((spotsUsed + (pendingGuests / 2)) / capacity) * 100`
- **Hide "Pending" label** if it would overlap with edge labels:
  - Too close to "Confirmed"/"Approved": `< 30%`
  - Too close to "Spots available"/"Available": `> 65%`
- When hidden, the pending section visual remains but label is removed
- Prevents visual clutter and overlapping text

### Capacity Request Page Simplifications
**Minimal, focused interface:**
- **Capacity meter**: Show only the meter with embedded numbers, no redundant text lines
  - Format: Black bar with white number, gray background with black number
  - Labels below: "Approved" on left, "Available" on right
- **Request input**: Number input with +/- buttons
  - Number input border: `rounded-full` (pill-shaped, not `rounded-xl`)
- **Comments field**:
  - Placeholder text: just "Comments" (not "Explain why you need...")
  - No separate label needed
- **Remove**: "Request Preview" section entirely (unnecessary)

### Dashboard Copy & Messaging
**Promoter Dashboard:**
- Header subtitle: "Invite friends to an upcoming night" (not "Invite some friends to come to a night")
- Keep messaging concise and action-oriented

### Form Input Field Styling
**Pill-shaped inputs for inline controls:**
- Number inputs in inline controls (like capacity requests): `rounded-full`
- Standard form inputs: `rounded-xl`
- Readonly/display inputs: `rounded-full` with `bg-gray-100`

### Modal Overlay Specifications
**Consistent overlay design for all modals:**
- **Background**: `bg-gray-600 bg-opacity-30` (30% opacity gray)
- **Never use**: Black overlays (`bg-black`) or higher opacity backgrounds
- **Applies to**: All modal dialogs, popups, detail cards, and edit forms
- **Z-index**: Nested modals should increment z-index appropriately
  - Primary modals: `z-50`
  - Secondary modals (on top of primary): `z-[60]`
- **Transition animations**:
  - Fade out/in: `0.4s ease-in-out`
  - Opacity keyframes: `0% → 1`, `50% → 0`, `100% → 1`
  - Apply to modal content, not overlay

**Examples:**
- DJ detail modal: Gray overlay
- Edit DJ details popup: Gray overlay (layered on top)
- Guest attendance history: Gray overlay
- Ban confirmation: Gray overlay

**DESIGN STANDARD**: This gray overlay creates visual consistency and reduces eye strain while maintaining clear focus on the modal content. All future modals must follow this specification.
