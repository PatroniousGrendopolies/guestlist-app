# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This document describes the CI/CD pipeline setup for the Guestlist App project.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and consists of two main parts:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Runs tests and linting on every push and pull request
2. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automatically deploys the application to production when changes are pushed to the main branch

## Workflow Files

- `ci.yml`: Handles testing and linting only
- `cd-vercel.yml`: Handles deployment to Vercel
- `cd-netlify.yml`: Handles deployment to Netlify
- `ci-cd.yml`: Combined workflow that handles both testing and deployment

## Required Secrets

To use these workflows, you need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

### For All Deployments
- `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for your production database
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Secret key for NextAuth.js
- `PRODUCTION_URL`: Your production site URL

### For Vercel Deployment
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: API token from Vercel

### For Netlify Deployment
- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`: API token from Netlify
- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`: ID of your Netlify site
- `NETLIFY_URL`: URL of your Netlify deployment

## Setting Up Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Add each required secret

## Choosing a Deployment Platform

The repository includes workflows for both Vercel and Netlify. Choose one based on your preference:

### Using Vercel
1. Create an account on Vercel
2. Create a new project
3. Generate a Vercel API token
4. Add the token as a GitHub secret
5. Use the `cd-vercel.yml` workflow or uncomment the Vercel section in `ci-cd.yml`

### Using Netlify
1. Create an account on Netlify
2. Create a new site
3. Generate a Netlify API token
4. Add the token and site ID as GitHub secrets
5. Use the `cd-netlify.yml` workflow or uncomment the Netlify section in `ci-cd.yml`

## Database Migrations

The CI workflow includes a step to run Prisma migrations. This ensures that your test database schema is up-to-date.

For production deployments, you should set up a migration step in your deployment process or run migrations manually before deploying.

## Compliance Considerations

Since the application needs to comply with Quebec privacy laws, ensure that:

1. Your database is hosted in Canada
2. Your deployment platform has Canadian region options
3. All data processing complies with local privacy regulations

## Monitoring and Logs

After deployment, you can monitor your application using:

- GitHub Actions run logs
- Vercel/Netlify deployment logs
- Application-specific monitoring tools
