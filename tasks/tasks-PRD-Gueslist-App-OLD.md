### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- The application will use Next.js for the frontend and API routes, with Prisma for database access.
- All data must be stored in Canada to comply with Quebec privacy laws.
