# Nightclub Guest List Management System - Master PRD
**Last Updated:** October 14, 2025
**Project:** Datcha Nightclub, Montreal

## Project Overview

A comprehensive guest list management platform for nightclubs. The system manages event creation, DJ invitations, guest registrations, capacity limits, QR code check-ins, and provides analytics for optimization.

### Core User Roles

- **DJ**: Manages guest lists, approves/denies guests, monitors capacity
- **Promoter**: Tracks capacity, manages guest lists
- **Doorperson/Staff**: Scans QR codes, checks in guests, monitors capacity
- **Guest**: Signs up for events, receives QR codes, checks in

### Development Phases
This project follows a strategic 3-phase approach to deliver value quickly while building toward a comprehensive nightclub CRM platform.
