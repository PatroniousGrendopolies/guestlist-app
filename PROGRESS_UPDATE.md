- ✅ Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- ✅ Mobile-first approach

## 🚦 Risk Assessment

**LOW RISK**:
- Core authentication working ✅
- Database structure established ✅
- Deployment pipeline functional ✅

**MEDIUM RISK**:
- RLS policy configuration needs attention
- Need to test all user role flows end-to-end

**HIGH PRIORITY ITEMS**:
1. Fix Supabase RLS policies to remove temporary workaround
2. Complete user profile management
3. Begin guest list data model design

## 📊 Success Metrics Progress
