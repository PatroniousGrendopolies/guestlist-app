# TODO - Guestlist App Development

## Current Status - READY FOR DEPLOYMENT! ðŸš€
âœ… All role pages (Manager, DJ, Staff, Promoter) fully connected to backend
âœ… Comprehensive test data created with 8 test users across all roles
âœ… RLS policies enabled and tested - working correctly
âœ… Environment-based authentication setup (disabled in dev, enabled in production)
âœ… Environment variables documented in `.env.example`

## Deployment Checklist

### Ready to Deploy
- [x] All backend connections complete (Manager, DJ, Staff, Promoter)
- [x] Test data created with realistic scenarios
- [x] RLS policies enabled and verified
- [x] Environment-based auth working (dev: disabled, prod: enabled)
- [x] Environment variables documented

### Deploy to Netlify
- [ ] Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (only for server operations)
- [ ] Push to main branch (triggers auto-deploy)
- [ ] Test production build with all roles
- [ ] Verify authentication works in production

## Test Users Available
All passwords follow pattern: `[Role]123!`

**Managers:**
- manager@datcha.com / Manager123!
- manager2@datcha.com / Manager123!

**DJs:**
- dj.shadow@music.com / DJShadow123!
- dj.luna@music.com / DJLuna123!

**Staff:**
- alex.staff@datcha.com / Staff123!
- jamie.staff@datcha.com / Staff123!

**Promoters:**
- alex.promoter@marketing.com / Promoter123!
- taylor.promoter@marketing.com / Promoter123!

### Guest Flow & Authentication
- [ ] **Google OAuth Configuration** ðŸŽ¯ HIGH PRIORITY
  - Google OAuth implementation complete (code deployed)
  - Need to configure Google Cloud Console
  - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID environment variable
  - See `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md` for complete setup instructions
  - **Impact**: Reduces signup friction from 7 fields to 1 click
  - **Expected**: +12-16 more guests per event (80 invited â†’ 68-72 signups)

- [ ] Guest signup flow improvements
  - Make Instagram Handle optional (currently required, blocks signups)
  - Consider simpler password requirements
  - Reduce form from 7 fields to essentials
  - QR code generation after approval
  - Email notifications

- [ ] Check-in functionality
  - QR code scanning
  - Manual check-in
  - Real-time capacity updates

### Low Priority
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Export guest lists
- [ ] Bulk operations (approve all, etc.)

## Recent Completed Work

### Guest Authentication & OAuth Implementation (Current Session - Oct 22, 2025)
- âœ… **Guest Authentication Flow**
  - Fixed guest signup (was failing with 500 error)
  - Created admin Supabase client with service role key
  - Fixed dashboard database query errors
  - Successfully tested complete signup and login flows
  - Test account: sarah.johnson@nightlist.com / GuestPass123!

- âœ… **Google OAuth Implementation** (Code Complete - Config Needed)
  - Implemented Google Sign-In button using @react-oauth/google
  - Created `/api/auth/guest/google` OAuth callback endpoint
  - Server-side token verification with google-auth-library
  - Automatic account creation for Google users
  - Email pre-verified for Google accounts
  - Comprehensive setup guide created (GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md)
  - **Next**: Configure Google Cloud Console and set environment variable

### Deployment Preparation - Phase 1-4 Complete (Previous Session)
- âœ… **Phase 1: Backend Connections**
  - Created `/api/staff/guest-lists` endpoint with full statistics
  - Created `/api/promoter/guest-lists` endpoint with full statistics
  - Connected Staff Dashboard to real data
  - Connected Promoter Dashboard to real data
  - Verified Event Manage pages working for all roles

- âœ… **Phase 2: Test Data Creation**
  - Created comprehensive test data script (`scripts/create-comprehensive-test-data.js`)
  - Generated 8 test users across all roles (Manager, DJ, Staff, Promoter)
  - Created 5 events (3 upcoming, 2 past) with realistic dates
  - Generated 30 guest lists (6 per event)
  - Populated with hundreds of guest entries (varied statuses: pending, approved, denied)
  - Past events include check-in data (80% attendance rate)
  - All test credentials documented for easy testing

- âœ… **Phase 3: RLS & Authentication**
  - Reviewed all 29 RLS policies (properly configured)
  - Tested RLS with anonymous and authenticated users
  - Verified role-based access control working
  - Confirmed auth flow with test users
  - Validated guest list isolation (users only see their own lists)

- âœ… **Phase 4: Documentation**
  - Updated `.env.example` with comprehensive documentation
  - Added Netlify deployment instructions
  - Documented all required environment variables
  - Added security warnings for service role key
  - Updated TODO.md with deployment checklist

### DJ Pages - Backend Integration (Previous Session)
- âœ… Created `/api/guest-list-entries/[entryId]` for single guest fetch
- âœ… Connected DJ Dashboard to fetch real events from `/api/events/[id]`
- âœ… Connected DJ Event Manage page with real guest entries
- âœ… Fixed infinite loop caused by `showToast` in useEffect dependencies
- âœ… Fixed guest name mapping to use nested object structure (`guest.first_name`, `guest.last_name`)
- âœ… Connected DJ Guest Details page with approve/deny functionality
- âœ… All changes committed and pushed to GitHub

### Manager Pages - Backend Integration (Previous Session)
- âœ… Created core API routes (`/api/events`, `/api/guest-lists`, etc.)
- âœ… Connected Manager Dashboard to real Supabase data
- âœ… Connected Manager Event Details page with capacity tracking
- âœ… Implemented approve/deny with database persistence

## Known Issues
- None blocking deployment!
- Auth is disabled in dev mode (controlled by `ENABLE_AUTH_IN_DEV=false`)
  - To test auth locally: set `ENABLE_AUTH_IN_DEV=true` in `.env.local`
  - In production, auth is always enabled

## Technical Notes
- Using Next.js 15.3.3 with App Router
- Supabase for PostgreSQL database
- API routes follow pattern: `/src/app/api/...`
- All pages map snake_case DB fields to camelCase in frontend

## Available MCP Tools
- **Playwright MCP**: Installed for automated browser testing
  - Use for testing user flows, screenshots, and UI validation
  - Example: `mcp__playwright__*` tools

- **Netlify**: Deployment platform (not Vercel)
  - Vercel config files were removed
  - Deploy via git push or Netlify CLI

## Environment Variables (Netlify)
Required environment variables in Netlify dashboard:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (if needed for server operations)
