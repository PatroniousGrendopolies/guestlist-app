# NextAuth.js v5 Implementation Roadmap

## Current Status

- Using NextAuth.js v5.0.0-beta.28
- Implemented mock handlers and auth functions as workarounds for API instability
- Authentication logic forced to run in Node.js runtime
- Basic functionality working but not production-ready

## Migration Path to Stable Implementation

### Phase 1: Monitor NextAuth.js v5 Releases

- Subscribe to NextAuth.js GitHub repository for release notifications
- Review release notes for API stability improvements
- Test new releases in a development environment before upgrading

### Phase 2: Replace Mock Implementations

When a stable version is available:

1. Update NextAuth.js dependency:

```bash
npm install next-auth@latest
```

2. Replace mock handlers with official NextAuth.js handlers:

```typescript
// src/lib/auth/auth.ts
import {
  signIn as nextAuthSignIn,
  signOut as nextAuthSignOut,
  auth as nextAuthAuth,
} from 'next-auth';

// Replace mock implementations with official ones
export const auth = nextAuthAuth;
export const signIn = nextAuthSignIn;
export const signOut = nextAuthSignOut;
```

3. Update any changed API patterns in login/logout components

### Phase 3: Implement Production-Ready Features

- Secure password hashing with bcrypt in Node.js runtime
- Email verification flow
- Password reset functionality
- Remember me functionality
- Multi-factor authentication (if needed)

### Phase 4: Security Hardening

- CSRF protection review
- Rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Security headers configuration
- Session management improvements

## Fallback Plan

If NextAuth.js v5 stability issues persist:

- Consider downgrading to stable NextAuth.js v4
- Adapt code to v4 API patterns
- Implement missing features manually if needed
